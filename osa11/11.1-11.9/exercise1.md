As Python is very popular, it also has many tool built for ci/cd.
For your linting purposes one of the most popular is pylint. Pylint is able to check for various code quality issues such as style violations, bugs and code smell. I provides a detailed report and suggestions for improvement. For testing purposes these is unittest, which is a built-in testing framework. It provides all the needed tools for creating and running unit tests. Unittests also creates comprohensive test reports for the developer to use. setuptools is one of the most popular packaging and distributing python projects. Its builds are easy to share and install.
There are many options beside the usual jenkins and github actions. These include gitlab ci/cd, circleCI, Azure DevOps, AWS codePipeline, buildkite and teamcity. 
I'd say for a team with 6+ people with an application getting ready for launch, the cloud based solution sounds the best. It would offer them a lot of scalability, faster setups and be cost-effective as they wont need to dedicate hardware to the job. Maintaining hardware with this team size would be unpractical. Some of the team members would have to probably dedicate their days to this task and that would take away from the application development.
